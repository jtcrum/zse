# Zeolite Simulation Environment
Authors: Jerry T. Crum, Justin R. Crum

## Description
This is a package to automate zeolite structure generation and characterization for computational chemistry.

## Requirements
This package is built around the ASE atoms object, and thus requires installation of ASE, available at: [https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/install.html](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/install.html).

Ring finding uses graph theory implemented by NetworkX, available at: [https://networkx.github.io](https://networkx.github.io).

Numpy is also required.

## Installation
Clone this git repository,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtcrum/zse
```

and then install it with pip:

```bash
pip install ./zse
```

## Current Modules
To see how to use each of the modules, please visit [examples](/examples).
- zse.cation
- zse.cif_tools
- zse.collections
- zse.protonate
- zse.rings
- zse.substitute
- zse.tpairs
- zse.utilities
