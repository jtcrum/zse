'''
The goal of this module is to identify the rings associated with an oxygen or
tsite in any given zeolite framework. This method uses graph theory to find
neighbors of the specified atom, and then a depth first search for a cycle back
to that atom. To make the code as efficient as possible, its important to
include what types are rings are possible in that framework. This information is
stored within the collections module of this package. Check the examples page on
github (github.com/jtcrum/zse/examples) for specifics on how to use.
