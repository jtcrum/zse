    "This module is the crown jewel of ZSE. I have developed algorithms using graph theory that are able to find rings in zeolite frameworks. There are a number of uses for this information. I use ring finding to in the zse.cation.py module to place cations in each of the rings associated with a T-site. Our group uses the rings associated with an oxygen or a T-site to classify them in a more descriptive way than just saying O1 or T4. Most recently I have been using the rings associated with an oxygen site, tetrahedral site, and entire framework as descriptors for neural networks. I have been able to predict deprotonoation energies, and proton location energies using these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various \"rules\" have been published to determine which cycles to include in ring finding. I have implemented 3 of those rules in ZSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "All rings found follow the rule presented by Goetzke and and Klein (https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-3093(91)90145-V). The algorithm used to find those rings is also an implementation of the algorithm presented in that same paper. This is the default validation method applied by ZSE. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sastre and Corma presented a rule that counts all of the rings that pass through an atom in a zeolite framework (https://doi.org/10.1021/jp8100128). This rule counts a ring if for any oxygen-oxygen first nearest neighbor pair along the cycle, the cycle is the shortest path that connects them. Use \"validation = 'sastre'\" to get results in accordance with this rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertex symbols are the conventional way of describing T-sites in zeolites, shown (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0144-2449(97)00133-4). The IZA Structure Database (http://www.iza-structure.org/databases/) lists these results as well. A T-site has 6 oxygen-oxygen pairs associated with it, the vertex symbol lists the shortest ring connecting each oxygen-oxygen pair, as well as any degeracies. Use \"validation = 'vertex'\" to get results in accordance with this rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This rule only works when the index provided is a T-site, ZSE cannot find vertex symbols for an oxygen atom in the zeolite framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I have created my own rule that finds a subset of rings between the Goetzke and Sastre methods. Stacked even membered rings result in a composite ring that traverses both the top and bottom stacked rings. An example is a 14-MR in AFI because of the stacked 12-MRs. This ring fits the definition according to Goetzke and Klein, however may not be relevant for researchers. My new rule removes these composite rings. Use \"validation='crum'\" to get results in accordance with this rule."
