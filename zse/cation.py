    This function will place one divalent cation into a zeolite framework that
    contains two negative charge centers.
    The cation is placed at each of 6 rings around each of the aluminum atoms.
    This creates 12 structures. Depending on the placement of your Al, some of
    the strucutres may not be unique.

    The structures will be placed in the path provided as an input.
    Format of the structures folder names are:
    D-aluminum_index-oxygen1_index,oxygen2_index.

    The original version of this code was written by Sichi Li in 2017.

    This code has been updated to place the ion inside each of the rings
    associated with the T site. The rings are found using the rings module of
    ZSE.
    INPUTS:
    atoms = ASE atoms object of the zeolite framework
    index = Index of the t site that the cation will be associated with (int)
    symbol = Elemental symbol of the cation you want to use, i.e. 'Na' (str)

    included_rings (optional) = List of ints for rings you want to include

                                be inlcuded.
    path (optional) = Path for which you would like the structure files saved.
                      If not included, structure files will not be saved.
    bvect (optional) = Manually specify the bond length between the cation and
                        atom index
    OUTPUTS:
    traj = ASE trajectory of all the structures generated. You can view traj
